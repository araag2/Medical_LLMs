Patient cohorts may involve 1-2 groups, and sections can vary in detail due to treatment types, doses, frequency, duration, and baseline characteristics.\n\nThe eligibility criteria outline patient inclusion and exclusion conditions, determining the suitability of patients for the study. The intervention specifies treatment type, dosage, frequency, and duration. The results section summarizes participant details, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and the adverse events detail observed signs, symptoms, or issues. Claims in statements must align with CTR information, be supported, and not contradict the descriptions.\n\nTo establish semantic entailment, a claim in the statement must be related to the CTR section, be consistent with the information in the report, and not contradict the details presented.
