    "prompt": "Evaluate the semantic entailment between individual sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements issued by clinical domain experts. CTRs expound on the methodology and outcomes of clinical trials, appraising the efficacy and safety of new treatments. The statements, on the other hand, assert claims about the information within specific sections of CTRs, for a single CTR or comparative analysis of two. For entailment validation, the statement's claim should align with clinical trial information, find support in the CTR, and refrain from contradicting provided descriptions.\n\nThe provided descriptions coincide with the content in a specific section of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), detailing relevant information to the trial.\n\nPrimary Trial:\n$primary_evidence\n\nSecondary Trial:\n$secondary_evidence\n\nConsider also the following statement generated by a clinical domain expert, a clinical trial organizer, or a medical researcher.\n\n$hypothesis\n\nAnswer YES or NO to the question of whether one can conclude the validity of the statement with basis on the clinical trial report information.

Women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter.\n  Negative HCG pregnancy test for premenopausal women of reproductive capacity and for women less than 12 months after the menopause.\n  Asymptomatic, central nervous system metastases are permitted if patients remain clinically stable after discontinuation of corticosteroids and anticonvulsants.\n  ECOG performance status < or = to 2\n  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks\n  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n  leukocytes  or = to 3,000/μL\n  absolute neutrophil count  or = 1,500/μL\n  platelets  or = 100,000/μL\n  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  or = 2.5x institutional upper limit of normal serum creatinine within normal institutional limits\n  Cardiac ejection fraction at or above the lower limit of normal of 50% as measured by multigated radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scan. If LVEF is greater than 70%, and ECHO should be performed as well. Baseline and on treatment scans should be performed using the same modality and preferably at the same institution.\n  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed. consent document.\n  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.\nExclusion Criteria:\n  Patients may not be receiving any concurrent anticancer therapy or investigational agents with the intention of treating breast cancer.\n  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to lapatinib or capecitabine.\n  Known DPD deficiency.\n  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lapatinib is member of the 4- anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lapatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lapatinib.\n  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with lapatinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.\n  Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis).\n  Concomitant requirement for medication classified as CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors:\n  Medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 are prohibited. Eligibility of patients receiving medications or substances known to affect, or with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of lapatinib will be determined following review of their use by the Principal Investigator.\n  Renal function as measured by creatinine clearance < 30ml/min\n  Patients are permitted to participate in other non-therapeutic clinical trials while receiving treatment on this study (ie, experimental imaging, minor procedures necessary for tissue acquisition on study)",

Women who are not menstruating regularly due to use of certain types of contraceptives may be entered with restrictions. Their estrogen progesterone, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels must be documented at baseline random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) and their off study RPFNA must take place at a similar portion of their cycle (high or low progesterone levels). In order to do this a serum progesterone will have to be obtained ~ 4 weeks before planned RPFNA and again 2 weeks later such that the RPFNA can be performed in the same phase of the \"cycle\" as baseline.\n  Subjects must be at increased risk for breast cancer on the basis of at least one of the following criteria:\n  A five-year Gail risk of  1.67% or three times the average risk for a woman of the same age using either the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER, http://seer.cancer.gov) database or the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool)., or 10 yr Tyrer-Cuzick risk twice that of the population risk as listed in model, or RPFNA atypia\n  BMI <40 Kg/m3\n  A first degree relative with breast cancer under the age of 60 or multiple second degree relatives with breast cancer.\n  Multiple prior biopsies or at least one prior biopsy exhibiting atypical hyperplasia (AH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n  RPFNA evidence of hyperplasia with atypia within the last three years;\n  Chest or neck radiation before age 30;\n  Mammographic breast density by visual estimate equals or exceeds 50%.\n  Subjects must be willing to continue the same hormonal milieu present at baseline throughout trial. If not using an oral, vaginal, or topical contraceptive, must be willing to actively use barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy.\n  Six months or more must have elapsed from completion of a prevention intervention trial (with exception of a weight reduction trial), ingestion of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or aromatase inhibitor (AI) prior to baseline biomarker assessment.\n  Subjects must be willing to undergo measurement of height, weight, and BMI and undergo body composite analysis (DEXA) at initiation and conclusion of intervention.\n  Subjects with a history of AH, LCIS, or ER-positive DCIS by diagnostic biopsy, must have been counseled about appropriate standard prevention therapies such as tamoxifen and are either not eligible or are not interested in standard prevention therapies. Women with DCIS must have had appropriate local therapy (lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy). If subject has had a DCIS, at least two months must have elapsed from surgery and/or radiation therapy to the involved breast. Only the contralateral (uninvolved breast) will be studied by RPFNA. The subject may not have had any radiation therapy to the contralateral breast to be studied\n  Subjects > 40 must have had a screening mammogram within 6 months of entering the interventional portion of the study and read as not suspicious for breast cancer or if suspicious must have completed all suggested tests including biopsy and found to have no evidence of cancer. Subjects of sufficient age and/or risk for a baseline mammogram must be willing to have an off-study mammogram performed 6 months after study entry.\n  Subjects must have had an RPFNA of the breast within six months prior to entering the intervention portion of the study and be willing to have another RPFNA at ~6.5 months after starting Lovaza™.\nTissue Eligibility: Subjects must have cytomorphologic evidence of hyperplasia with atypia or borderline atypia (Masood score 14 or higher). There must be 500 epithelial cells on the slide for cytomorphology and evidence of proliferation by Ki-67 staining. There must be sufficient reserved methanol- formalin-fixed material for real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
